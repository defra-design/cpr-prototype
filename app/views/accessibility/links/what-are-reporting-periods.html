      What are ‘reporting periods’?
    </h1>

    <p class="govuk-body">You need to report data that shows your members’ packaging activities over a period of time. Each period of time is called a 'reporting period’.</p>
  
    <p class="govuk-body">You may need to collect some information before the period starts, and you submit the data after the period has finished. This means you’ll have tasks for more than one reporting period at the same time.</p>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">Each reporting period has a deadline to submit all the data by. This is called the ‘submission deadline’.</p>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">There are different reporting periods and submission deadlines for large and small organisations.</p>
