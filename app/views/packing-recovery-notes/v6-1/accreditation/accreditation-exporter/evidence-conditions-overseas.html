<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>The packaging waste is separated at source, or processed, to ensure it is exported for reprocessing within a shipment of similar material – for example, if the shipment contains steel drink cans and steel scrap and is not a general mix of different materials (such as paper and plastic), or a mixture of different grades of the same material (for example, different plastic polymers)</li>
  <li>There is a well-established international technical specification for the exported packaging waste material that your consignments meet</li>
  <li>The material needs only limited processing overseas before it is recovered, and the recycling process has losses that meet EU industry standards</li>
  <li>Processing the waste material before recycling does not include hand-sorting that may cause significant harm to human health</li>
  <li>The material goes through a recognised form of recycling, and is unlikely to cause significant harm to the environment.</li>
