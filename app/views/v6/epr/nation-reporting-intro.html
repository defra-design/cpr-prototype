        <p>As part of the EPR regulations, your organisation might need to report packaging data for goods it sold in each nation. This means telling us how much packaging you sold in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p>There are no fees associated with this data. We need it so that we can measure against recycling rate targets.</p>
        <p>In this section, we’ll ask you about the activities your organisation carries out, to check whether you must report your data by nation. If you need to, you’ll do this annually, at the same time as you report your other data.</p>
