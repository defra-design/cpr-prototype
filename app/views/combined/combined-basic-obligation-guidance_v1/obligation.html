        <p>The collection and packaging reforms include two schemes, extended producer responsibility (EPR) and the deposit return scheme (DRS). Businesses may need to register for one or both schemes.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">EPR scheme criteria</h3>
        
        <p>Your business must register for the EPR scheme if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>it had a turnover above £1 million in its last financial year</li>
            <li>it handled at least 25 tonnes of packaging or packaging materials between 1 January 2022 and 31 December 2022</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">DRS criteria</h3>

        <p>Your business must register for the DRS if it carries out at least one of these activities:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>fills drinks containers with its own branded drinks to place on the market in England, Wales or Northern Ireland</li>
            <li>imports filled drinks containers from outside of the UK to place on the market in England, Wales or Northern Ireland</li>
            <li>sells filled drinks containers to end consumers in England, Wales or Northern Ireland</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            If you’re not sure, you can <a href="">check if your business needs to register for the schemes</a>.
