                    <p class="govuk-body">Under the new regulations, you may need to:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>collect and submit data on the packaging you handle and supply</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p class="govuk-body">The steps you must take to comply with the regulations will depend on whether you are classed as a ‘small’ or ‘large’ organisation. This is based on:</p>

                        <li>your annual turnover</li>

                    <p class="govuk-body">If you sell packaged goods or empty packaging in the UK, you may also need to submit ‘nation data’. This is information about which country in the UK your packaging has been sold, hired or loaned in.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">You can <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="#">use a compliance scheme</a> to complete certain steps on your behalf.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">You will be classed as a small organisation if either of the following apply:</p>

                        <li>your annual turnover is between £1 million and £2 million and you’re responsible for handling and supplying more than 25 tonnes of empty packaging or packaged goods through the UK market</li>

                    <p class="govuk-body">Your data submission must include the weight of:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>individual materials in the packaging you handle and supply</li>
                        <li>materials used in your 'primary', 'secondary', 'shipment' and 'transit' packaging</li>
                        <li>packaging likely to become household or non-household waste</li>
                        <li>packaging likely to end up in street bins</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="govuk-body">Your 2023 data will be used to calculate:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>your waste management fees in the financial year 2024 to 2025 by the scheme administrator</li>
                        <li>the amount of PRNs and PERNs you must buy to cover your 2024 recycling obligations by the regulator</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="govuk-body">From 2025, the scheme administrator will adjust your waste management fees depending on the cost of recycling the materials used in your packaging you handle and supply.</p>


                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-5">How to report material type</h3>
                    <p class="govuk-body">You must collect data on the weight of individual material types used in the packaging you handle and supply. Give all weights to the nearest tonne (1,000kg).</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">You should categorise your data by the following materials:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>aluminium</li>
                        <li>fibre-based composite </li>
                        <li>glass</li>
                        <li>paper or cardboard</li>
                        <li>plastic</li>
                        <li>steel</li>
                        <li>wood</li>
                        <li>other</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="govuk-body">For example, you may report that you have handled and supplied 20 tonnes of paper and 5 tonnes of plastic.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">If you report materials under ‘other’, you must state the weight of each material type. You must also state how much of each material is used in the ‘primary’, ‘secondary' or ‘transit’ packaging you handle and supply.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">For example, if you handled or supplied 20 tonnes of paper, you may report that you used:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>10 tonnes in primary packaging</li>
                        <li>10 tonnes in secondary packaging</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-5">Primary packaging</h3>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Primary packaging is the individual container that you store goods in to sell to consumers. This is called a ‘sales unit’.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">For example, if you sell peas in steel tins with paper labels, the primary packaging is ‘steel tin’ and ‘paper label’.</p>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-5">Secondary and shipment packaging</h3>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Secondary packaging is for grouping several ‘sales units’ for selling or shipping purposes. Organisations may use secondary packaging to display goods in shops.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Shipment packaging is a type of secondary packaging for shipping single or multiple sales units to consumers. This includes cardboard boxes and mailing bags.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">For example, if you place one or more tins of peas into a cardboard box, then sell the box to a retailer or ship it to the consumer, the secondary packaging is ‘cardboard box’.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Or if you place a mobile phone in a cardboard box and then place the box into a mail bag before shipping it, the shipment packaging is ‘mail bag’. The primary packaging is ‘cardboard box’.</p>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-5">Transit packaging</h3>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Transit or tertiary packaging is used to group secondary packaging units together to protect them while being transported or handled.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Transit packaging does not include road, rail, ship and air containers.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">For example, if secondary packaging units are placed into larger cardboard boxes that are sealed with parcel tape and put onto wooden pallets to be transported, the transit packaging is 'cardboard box, parcel tape and wooden pallet'.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-5">Household and non-household packaging waste</h3>
                    <p class="govuk-body">You must submit the weight of packaging that ends up (or is likely to end up) as household and non-household waste.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">When calculating your waste management fees for the financial year 2024 to 2025, the scheme administrator will treat all primary and shipment packaging as household waste, unless you have clear evidence that some or all of the packaging is unlikely to become household waste.</p>
