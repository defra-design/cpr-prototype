                <!-- OVERVIEW -->
                <p class="govuk-body">The way UK organisations responsible for packaging must carry out their recycling responsibilities is changing.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">The regulations will apply to all UK organisations that handle and supply packaging to end consumers and to businesses.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">You must take action to comply if all the following apply:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>you’re an individual business, subsidiary or group (but not a charity)</li>
                        <li>you have an annual turnover of £1 million or more (based on your most recent annual accounts)</li>
                        <li>you're responsible for over 25 tonnes of packaging in a calendar year (January to December)</li>
                        <li>you carry out any of the packaging activities listed</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-5">Packaging activities</h3>
                    <p class="govuk-body">You may need to act if you do any of the following:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>pay another organisation to produce, pack or place your branded goods on the UK market</li>
                        <li>package goods on behalf of a UK organisation that isn’t obligated under EPR for packaging</li>
                        <li>import packaging that contains goods into the UK to sell</li>
                        <li>allow third parties based outside the UK to sell packaged products or empty packaging through an online marketplace that you own</li>
                        <li>hiring or loaning out reusable packaging to UK third parties</li>
                        <li>sell empty packaging to organisations that aren’t legally obligated under EPR for packaging, for example because their turnover is too low</li>
                        <li>hire out or lend reusable packaging to UK organisations</li>
                        <li>supply goods to the UK market in primary, secondary or shipment packaging under your own brand</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-5">Supplying goods under your own brand</h4>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Your company may be obligated under EPR if it sells packaged goods labelled with its own brand. A brand includes any of the following:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>a logo</li>
                        <li>a trademark</li>
                        <li>any distinctive mark </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="govuk-body">For example, a confectionary company produces packaged sweets under their own brand. It sells these sweets to a supermarket. The supermarket goes on to sell the sweets to UK consumers. In this instance, the confectionary company may need to take action.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">However, the confectionary company would not need to take action if it sold sweets to a supermarket who sold them under the supermarket brand. In this instance, the supermarket may need to take action.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">Packaging is any material that is used to cover or protect goods that are sold to consumers. It makes handling and delivering goods easier and safer. It includes anything that’s designed to be filled at the point of sale, such as a coffee cup.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Packaging also makes goods look appealing and it may display a company’s logo or brand. 'Goods' could include raw materials or processed items. </p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Packaging that is part of a deposit and return scheme is not covered by the regulations</p>

                        <li>register as individual subsidiaries (in this instance, the subsidiaries that meet the turnover and tonnage requirements comply with EPR for packaging independently)</li>
                        <li>register as a parent company for part of the group (this is where the parent company registers to comply with EPR for packaging on behalf of some, but not all of its subsidiaries)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="govuk-body">You should register as a parent company for part of the group if some of your subsidiaries don’t meet the turnover and tonnage requirements in their own right, but do meet the requirements when combined.

                    <p class="govuk-body">Your organisation should start preparing now to capture your packaging data.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">Your data submission must include the weight of:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>individual materials in the packaging you handle and supply</li>
                        <li>materials used in your 'primary', 'secondary', 'shipment' and 'transit' packaging</li>

                    <p class="govuk-body">The scheme administrator will use your 2023 data to calculate your waste management fees for the financial year 2024 to 2025.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">The regulator will use your 2023 data to calculate the amount of PRNs and PERNs you must buy to cover your recycling obligations for the 2024 calendar year.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">If you have registered for EPR for packaging as a parent company, you will need to submit data for each of the subsidiaries within your group separately, rather than as a combined group.</p>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-5">How to report material type</h3>
                    <p class="govuk-body">You must collect data on the weight of individual material types used in the packaging you handle and supply. Give all weights to the nearest tonne (1,000kg).</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">You should categorise your data by the following materials:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>aluminium</li>
                        <li>fibre-based composite </li>
                        <li>glass</li>
                        <li>paper or cardboard</li>
                        <li>plastic</li>
                        <li>steel</li>
                        <li>wood</li>
                        <li>'other'</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="govuk-body">‘Other’ includes any materials you use that aren’t listed here. For example, other materials could include:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>biodegradable plastics (compostable plastics made of plant-based products)</li>
                        <li>cork</li>
                        <li>cotton</li>
                        <li>flax-seed products</li>
                        <li>nitril</li>
                        <li>rubber</li>
                        <li>silicone</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="govuk-body">You must report each material type separately. For example, you may report that you have handled and supplied 20 tonnes of paper and 5 tonnes of plastic.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">If you report materials under ‘other’, you must state the weight of each material type.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">You must also state how much of each material is used in the ‘primary’, ‘secondary’ or ‘transit’ packaging you handle and supply.</p>


                    <p class="govuk-body">For example, if you handled or supplied 20 tonnes of paper, you may report that you used:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>10 tonnes in primary packaging</li>
                        <li>10 tonnes in secondary packaging</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="govuk-body">You must also submit the weight of packaging that may end up as household and non-household waste.</p>


                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-5">Primary packaging</h3>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Primary packaging is the individual container that you store goods in to sell to consumers. This is called a ‘sales unit’.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">For example, if you sell peas in steel tins with paper labels, the primary packaging is ‘steel tin’ and ‘paper label’.</p>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-5">Secondary and shipment packaging</h3>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Secondary packaging is for grouping several ‘sales units’ for selling or shipping purposes. Organisations may use secondary packaging to display goods in shops.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Shipment packaging is a type of secondary packaging for shipping single or multiple sales units to consumers. This includes cardboard boxes and mailing bags.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">For example, if you place one or more tins of peas into a cardboard box, then sell the box to a retailer or ship it to the consumer, the secondary packaging is ‘cardboard box’.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Or if you place a mobile phone in a cardboard box and then place the box into a mail bag before shipping it, the shipment packaging is ‘mail bag’. The primary packaging is ‘cardboard box’.</p>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-5">Transit packaging</h3>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Transit or tertiary packaging is used to group secondary packaging units together to protect them while being transported or handled.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Transit packaging does not include road, rail, ship and air containers.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">For example, if secondary packaging units are placed into larger cardboard boxes that are sealed with parcel tape and put onto wooden pallets to be transported, the transit packaging is 'cardboard box, parcel tape and wooden pallet'.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">You only need to submit information about reusable packaging, such as pallets, the first time they are used. </p>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-5">Household and non-household packaging waste</h3>
                    <p class="govuk-body">You must submit the weight of packaging that ends up (or is likely to end up) as household and non-household waste. We will publish a list of items classed as household and non-household waste.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">When calculating your waste management fees for the financial year 2024 to 2025, the scheme administrator will treat all primary and shipment packaging as household waste, unless you have clear evidence that some or all of the packaging is unlikely to become household waste.</p>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-5">Street bin waste</h3>
                    <p class="govuk-body">You must submit data about the weight of packaging that is likely to end up in street bins.</p>
